 Minecraft C# Launcher open source
 i only edited to my like, added and fixed some stuff
 
 you can install forge and others mods like normal launcher :D
 
 If you have this error just close the solution and reopen it to fix it

 By default minecraft folder will be in the same place as the launcher so you can use it as portable minecraft
